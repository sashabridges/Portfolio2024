        <h2>Teaching</h2>
        In her free time, Sasha is a teaching assistant with EdX in the Data Analysis and Visualization track, 
        where students are introduced to programming with Excel's Visual Basic extension and then move on to 
        Python and JavaScript. Students are introduced to APIs and then build their own dashboards with Flask.
        <br />

        Students also become proficient using Numpy and Pandas to analyze data. At the end, they even cover
        different types of machine learning and how to utilize big data.
